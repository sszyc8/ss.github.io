description: We met in 2015 on a rainy day in a capsule hostel in Tokyo on my first solo trip away from Singapore. Connected in our love for the city, and for visual storytelling. We kept in touch sporadically, and met again for the second time in a long while back in Singapore.

We met in 2015 on a rainy day in a capsule hostel in Tokyo on my first solo trip away from Singapore. Connected in our love for the city, and for visual storytelling. We kept in touch sporadically, and met again for the second time in a long while back in Singapore.

Seeing each other again, after all that time, and talking about the things we have been through and accomplished, in many ways seems surreal even as I took these photos of him, and as I write this. It goes to show how the smallest of reasons could be the basis of connection, of which, held strong over an extended period of time, which could be probably be a matter of expectations.
