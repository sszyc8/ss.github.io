Do not get me wrong this is first and foremost a place for my images and the attention should be solely on them. You can call it my portfolio if you like.

&lt;p&gt;It has been a long time coming, I have long wanted to create a site just for this. Lo and behold, here it is. There has been a lot of tinkering, and it is a work in progress so you&apos;ll see a lot of changes from now on. But generally, this is how it should look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More photos would be uploaded eventually once I get my hands on a dedicated film scanner. Till then, enjoy what is there right now.&lt;/p&gt;

That is in the technical sense. But there&apos;s also the aesthetic quality that we have to talk about, or rather I do. I am not quite satisfied with it. I don&apos;t quite know what to do with the existing images that I do have besides editing them the best I can and uploading them here. Of course, Instagram hides the flaws more but I suppose the whole point of having this site is to be honest about everything.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2017 13:28:26 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As I have said before the lack of dedicate film scanner means that the quality of the photos are sub-par.
